            <p>I am a student of Inter 1st year. I will give my H.S.C in 2023. I want to be a good programmer or web developer in future. I work hard to be a web developer. Before buying this course I also practiced for HTML and CSS for more than 8 months. But i was only learned HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I tried javascript but i can't. Then i have admitted on the course and now I work hard everyday. Now i can cover my module in 8-10 hours. But some day ago it took the whole day to complete the module. Now i work hard and practice if i have more time. I will work hard to achieve the goal because I want to be a great web developer or a programmer. I will try to get SCIC and ACC to make my knowledge more good about web development. If there is a barrier to learn web development, I will try to get out the barrier. A proverb says that - 'Hardwork is the key to success', I will work hard to learn web development.</p>
